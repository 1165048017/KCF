# KCF
I just want to build a c++ preject for KCF.

# Notice
###1.This project is c++ translator for MATLAB version.
###2.I change hog from opencv extra modules([DPM](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/blob/master/modules/dpm/src/dpm_feature.cpp)),it's a little different with fhog.

###3.I will optimize the code for fhog(SSE),fft.(Now it's very slow [David3 60fps])
